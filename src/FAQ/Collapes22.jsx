          Small-breed pups develop much faster than other breeds of dogs. They
          have faster metabolic rates and need higher levels of protein, fat,
          calcium, and phosphorus. Meanwhile, large-breed dogs aren't considered
          full grown until they're nearly 2 years old. And while many people
          think that large breeds should eat huge quantities of food, they
          simply need meals that pack a nutritional punch. (If overfed, these
          animals risk putting on too much weight too quickly and could develop
          skeletal problems.) The scientists at EUKANUBAâ„¢ have developed
          specific formulas for every size puppy so you'll be sure to know
          they've got all the nutrition they need to grow up healthy.
