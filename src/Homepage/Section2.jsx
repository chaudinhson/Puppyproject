          Hi!Â <a href="/">I'm Patrona</a>.I have not ever imaged that I can see
          many beautiful creatures in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          During our years of service in the army, we faced many challenges on
          difficult missions, inclement weather and homesickness.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Army dog did help us go through this tough day due to their
          friendly. Gradually, I realize that this creature is very beautiful
          and started to study about them with all of their characters.
